## Overview
Bucket for demonstrating easy to explain, but hard to implement "building
block" type programming concepts. These concepts lean more toward the practical
than the theoretical, and are very likely to be of direct use in a larger
project.

High minded things like implementations of
[TAoCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)
algorithms are unlikely to show up here. But if I had to climb a wall to work
something out for another project, I may take the time to pare it down to its
minimally complex implementation and store it here.

All of the concepts took time to work out that I wish to avoid investing in the
same way in the future. Most of these concepts have analogs elsewhere that may
be clearer and perhaps even more correct. What you find here may also be wrong,
misleading, dangerously insecure, and out of date.

Use what you find here as a general guide, and do not use any of it as a
license to stop thinking.

Patches are welcome and encouraged!
