## Overview
Bucket for demonstrating discrete "building block" type programming concepts.
The intention is to demonstrate ideas with the absolute bare minimum amount of
abstraction and complexity.

Generally the stuff you find here will be "easy to explain, but not worth
memorizing". Some of it may even be wrong, misleading, or even out of date.

All of the concepts took time to work out, and few of them are worth spending
time to work out in the same way in the future. Most of these have analogs
elsewhere that may be clearer and perhaps even more correct.

Patches are encouraged and welcomed!
