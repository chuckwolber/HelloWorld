## Overview
This work was tested on an
[NVIDIA Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
with version 4.5.1 of the [JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack).

Much of this work was directed by this tutorial:

https://cuda-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Changes have been added to make the profiler (nvprof) display the correct
information in the embedded JetPack SDK environment running on the Jetson Nano.
Non embedded environments allow for Unified Memory Profiling, so it is very
likely that the tutorial deviations are not required.
