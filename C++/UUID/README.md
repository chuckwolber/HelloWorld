## Overview
This is a C++ wrapper around the UUID functions provided by
[e2fsprogs](https://github.com/tytso/e2fsprogs). The intention is to make this
functionality available to C++ programs and usable as Keys and Values in
typical STL containers.

[Boost](https://www.boost.org) also contains UUID functionality. If your
project grows large enough to make using Boost practical, then that is probably
a better option.
